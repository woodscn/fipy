      - `filename`: The name of the file to place the pickled object. If `filename` is `None`
        then a temporary file will be used and the file object and file name will be returned as a tuple
      - `extension`: Used if filename is not given.
      - `communicator`: Object with `procID` and `Nproc` attributes.

    Test to check pickling and unpickling.
